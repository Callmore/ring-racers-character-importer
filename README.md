# Ring Racers Character Importer

:warning: _This is not at all complete and might never be fully completed._

Online tool to create and edit templates for use in Ring Racers.

In the future I want to also want to add the ability to export WAD character files.

## Usage

Drag and drop `properties.txt` and `sprites.png` onto the page. They will be loaded.
Click on the frames in the left bar to pick a frame, then drag the highlighted box around to move it around the image.

Currently there is no way to export templates, but I hope to add it soon.
